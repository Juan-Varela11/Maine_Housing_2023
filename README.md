# Housing Trends in Maine, USA
Exploratory analysis into historical data which details trends within the housing market of Maine, at a statewide and county level.

Supervised ML models were constructed and tested with historical data as an attempt to predict future housing trends in different economic, demographic, and age brackerts.

Steps:

1) **Data Collection**<br/>
Identifying and collecting the needed data for this study.

2) **Data Exploration**<br/>
Understading the data by describing it and visualizing it.

3) **Data Preparation**<br/>
Modifying the data so it is in the correct format for the intended machine learning process, by cleaning it, dealing with missing values, removing uneeded features, sampling data if original population is too large, etc.

4) **Modeling**<br/>
Selecting and applying the correct machine learning model for the intended problem that is desired to be solved. Must be clear of our objective at this stage of the ML process so that the correct model is chosen and this steps does not need to be repeated. 

5) **Evaluation**<br/>
Assessing how well the selected machine learning model worked in predicting future trends. 

6) **Actionable Insight**<br/>
Identifying what to do with the results based off of the machine learning model that was chosen.
